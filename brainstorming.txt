# Security Implementation Plan

## Code Obfuscation Requirements
Before production deployment, implement obfuscation to protect:
- Territory management algorithms
- Route optimization logic
- User role system
- Scoring/points calculations
- API integrations
- Business workflows

## Implementation Tools
Recommended obfuscation tools:
- Terser
- javascript-obfuscator
- UglifyJS

## Build Process Update
Add to package.json:
{
  "scripts": {
    "build:prod": "npm run build && npm run obfuscate",
    "obfuscate": "javascript-obfuscator ./public/dist/bundle.js --output ./public/dist/bundle.min.js"
  }
}

## Testing Requirements
- Verify all functionality after obfuscation
- Complete testing in staging environment
- Document all protected components
- Validate API integrations
- Performance testing post-obfuscation

## Timeline
- Implement before production deployment
- Include in staging environment testing
- Document security measures

## Notes
Priority: High
Must be completed before initial production release
Keep documentation of protected components for future maintenance

Phase 1: Core System Updates & Role Management

Role System Restructuring
Update existing roles (setter, closer)
Add manager role
Create role assignment interface in settings
Update security rules
Add role-specific views/access
Collection Structure Updates
Addresses collection stages
new_without_contact
do_not_solicit
damage_present
go_back
Contacts collection stages
new_without_address
do_not_solicit
address_added
Leads collection stages
appointment_scheduled
Basic UI Components
Implement reusable kanban board
Update navigation for new roles
Add settings interfaces
Phase 2: Territory & Map Enhancement

Territory Management
Create territory drawing interface
Territory assignment system
Boundary management
Territory sharing capabilities
Admin-only territory controls
Map Component Enhancement
Collection-based filters
Status-based pin colors
Territory overlay visualization
Area selection tools
Filter views by collection type
Phase 3: Task & Automation System

Task Management
Basic task creation
Door knock tracking
Flyer status tracking
Task assignment system
Task completion workflows
Automation System
Settings page automation builder
Notification rule configuration
Task generation rules
Follow-up automation
Phase 4: Integration Systems

GHL Integration
API connection setup
Contact sync
Appointment sync
Task sync
Error handling & retry logic
Notification System
Access request notifications
Territory-based alerts
Geographic grouping
Manager alerts
Task notifications
Phase 5: Advanced Features & Reporting

Progress Tracking
User performance metrics
Territory performance tracking
Conversion rate tracking
Activity logging
Reporting System
Basic reports
Custom report builder
Automated reporting
Export capabilities
Phase 6: Optimization & Enhancement

System Optimization
Performance improvements
Data caching
Load time optimization
Mobile responsiveness
User Experience Enhancements
Bulk operations
Advanced filters
Quick actions
User preferences
Dependencies & Considerations:


Role system must be completed before territory management
Collection structure updates needed before task system
Basic UI components required for all phases
GHL integration can be parallel to other development
Territory system needed before geographic notifications
